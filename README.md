# Tailwind CSS Hover Effect Bug

This repository demonstrates an uncommon bug encountered while using Tailwind CSS. The hover effect on a div element fails to work as expected, despite seemingly correct class names.

## Bug Description

A simple div element with Tailwind CSS classes for background color and hover effect is not responding to hover events. The expected behavior is that the background color should change on hover, but it remains unchanged.

## Solution

The solution involves ensuring the parent container doesn't have any conflicting styles that might prevent the hover effect from triggering.  Adding a specific width or ensuring proper structure can resolve this.
